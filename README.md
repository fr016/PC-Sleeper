# PC Sleeper

## Introduction

At some point, it might happen that you leave your computer running to complete a tedious task, such as downloading or uploading a large file, performing data backup, or synchronizing files with a server.

If the application that performs the operations does not come with integrated computer power control options, there are two solutions: you either use the Task Scheduler in Windows or, easier, run a dedicated power scheduler, such as PC Sleeper.

PC Sleeper makes it possible for you to avoid having to constantly  monitor your computer to see when it finishes the current task so you can shut it down.

Adopting a simplistic approach, it enables you to schedule system shutdown, restart, stand-by, and log off, all from a one-window interface with a drop-down menu.

The only thing you have to do is set the time interval after which the PC will perform the selected power task. There is a box for hours and one for minutes or specify an exact time(PM)

Once you hit the "Start" button, the countdown begins. At this point, your PC is configured to either shutdown, restart, stand-by, or log off the current user.
